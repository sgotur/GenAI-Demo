## Usage

This application, site, demos, and associated code are for demonstration purposes ONLY.  The code here should not be deployed to your production environment without security review.

## Contributing

To contribute, please create a feature branch from development with the name of your demo.  Complete all changes there and submit a PR to the development branch with @rangarap or @dabounds as reviewers at a minimum.  Once the PR is merged, it will be deployed to [Nonprod](https://staging.aws-gen.ai/).

Prod deployments are manual for the time being.
